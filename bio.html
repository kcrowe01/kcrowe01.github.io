	<h1> Kenneth Crowell </h1>
	<h2> A Short Biography </h2>
	<p> I was born on June 11, 1994 in Beverly Massachusetts where I have lived my entire life. Growing up I played basketball, baseball, and soccer which took up most of my free time. I attended Beverly High School and found myself much more interested in the sciences than anything else. After graduating I started attending Tufts University where I am currently studying Computer Science. I have been an avid gamer since my youth which I believe led me to the field that I am studying today. I took my first computer science course the second semester my freshman year and before the end of the semester I had declared it as my major. I hope to continue learning more about computer science in the future and to come out of college with a good understanding of how computing systems work. </p>
